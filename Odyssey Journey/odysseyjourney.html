<h1>Odysseus's Journey To The Underworld</h1>

<td><h3>Cimmeria</h3>
  <image src = "IMG_3321.jpg">
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“And she made the outer limits, the Ocean River’s bounds where 
      Cimmerian people have their homes—their realm and city shrouded in 
      mist and cloud”(Homer 15-16). In The Odyssey, we see a reference to 
      Cimmeria. To learn more about Cimmeria, secondary research helps us 
      get more information. “The real people of Cimmeria (pronounced and 
      sometimes spelt Kimmeria) are almost as cloaked in mystery as their 
      land is in Homer. It is hard to find decent, non-racially motivated 
      or Conan-related material on the internet about the Cimmerians”(Kay). 
      This shows that the people of Cimmeria are true mysteries. I represent this 
      by simply putting two pieces of land with rockier terrain on both 
      sides of the river.

<td><h3>The River Of Oceans</h3>
  <image src = "IMG_3326.jpg">
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“The sail stretched taut as she cut the sea all day and the sun sank 
      and the roads of the world grew dark. And she made the outer limits, 
      the Ocean River’s bounds”(Homer 13-15). The Odyssey references that 
      Odysseus must travel by boat in order to get to his destination. 
      Secondary research tells us that he travels on The River of Oceans. 
      “Odysseus journey to the Underworld through the River of Ocean located 
      on the island of the Cimmerians. Here he pours libations and performs 
      sacrifices, pouring blood into a cup to attract the souls to appear”(Clark). 
      The research done shows how the river goes through the island of Cimmeria. 
      To represent this, I put a river in the middle of the model. In addition 
      to this, I used the other references including no sunlight and the boat 
      with the river as well to make it as accurate as possible.

<td><h3>The Boat Of Odysseus</h3>
<image src = "IMG_3322.jpg">
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“Now down we came to the ship at the water’s edge, 
    we hauled and launched her into the sunlit breakers first, stepped the 
    mast in the black craft and set our sail”(Homer 1-3). The first three 
    lines of Book 11 immediately go straight to the idea that Odysseus 
    needs his ship in order to get to this destination. “There, gaining 
    that point, we beached our craft and herding out the sheep, we picked 
    our way by the Ocean’s banks until we gained the place that Circe made 
    our goal”(Homer 22-25). This shows that where he needed to go was only 
    reachable by his boat. The boat is an important part of the story, 
    because it is what helps him along his journey home.

<td><h3>The Land Of No Sunlight</h3>
  <image src = "IMG_3325.jpg">
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp“The eye of the Sun can never flash his rays through 
      the dark and bring them light, not when he climbs the starry 
      skies or when he wheels back down from the heights to touch the 
      earth once more— an endless, deadly night overhangs those wretched 
      men”(Homer 17-21). This quote supports the idea of how Cimmeria 
      receives no sunlight. The quote describes how the sun can't bring 
      them light, in addition to describing how an endless night overhangs 
      those in Cimmeria. To represent this idea, the land and the river is 
      painted black.

<td><h3>The Sacrifices</h3>
  <image src = "IMG_3324.jpg">
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn The Odyssey, we see Odysseus refer to sheep. He says, “and loaded 
      the sheep aboard, the ram and ewe,”(Homer 4). This points to the idea 
      that there were sheep on board, but reading further tells what their 
      purpose was. “I took the victims, over the trench I cut their throats 
      and the dark blood flowed in—and up out of Erebus they came, flocking 
      toward me now, the ghosts of the dead and gone…”(Homer 38-41). This 
      shows that the purpose of the sheep were to be sacrifices, and that 
      sacrificing them allows for the dead to come and for Odysseus to have
       these exchanges. I put four sheep in the back of the boat to represent 
       this.</p>
